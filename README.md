# Fractional Polynomial Noise

Experimental algorithm for gradient noise.

You can find the formula and a detailed explanation [here](docs/index.html).

## WebGL1 implementation (April 2021)

See it in action [here](webgl/noise2D.html).

## WebGL2 implementation (March 2021)

A bit more eye candy here.
Go to [shadertoy.com](https://www.shadertoy.com/)
and copy/paste [this script](shadertoy/noise2D.txt) into a fresh shader.

I would love to share the shader myself on shadertoy.com,
but I'm having trouble verifying my email address there. Sorry.
